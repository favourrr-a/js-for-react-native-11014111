# Project Name: js-for-react-native-11014111
## Project Overview:
This project contains JavaScript functions organized into separate files used to perform specific tasks related to array manipulation. Each task serves a different purpose.

### Task Details:
#### Task 1: Array Manipulation

Created a function processArray in arrayManipulation.js that manipulates an array of numbers. The function squares even numbers and triples odd numbers.

#### Task 2: Formatting Strings

Created a function formatArrayStrings in arrayManipulation.js that takes an array of strings and an array of numbers(processed by processArray) as arguments. The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number. It capitalizes strings if the number is even and converts them to lowercase if the number is odd.

#### Task 3: User Profiles

Created a function createUserProfiles in userInfo.js. The function generates user profile objects using arrays of names and formatted names obtained from Task 2.
Each profile includes originalName, modifiedName, and an auto-incremented id starting from 1.
